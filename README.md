# telegrao-py
This is the successor to [telegrao](https://github.com/lucasberti/telegrao), this time, completely from scratch using Python and the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

I started this project to learn Python, so while this code isn't the prettier it can be, I will rewrite most of this project sometime in the future to o perform optimizations and adhere to better coding practices.

Again, this is a personal project, tailored to a very specific group chat. Although it's not impossible to use this bot to a more general approach, it can be a bit difficult.
